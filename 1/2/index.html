    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      The term <q>scenario</q> has a variety of published definitions from a
      vast array of domains. While the term itself has varying meanings, two
      definitions represent a scenario in the context of simulation development
      and usage. First, a scenario can be defined as a description of the
      hypothetical or real area, environment, means, objectives, and events
      during a specified time frame related to events of interest (<a
        role="doc-biblioref" href="#GSD14">GSD Product Development Group,
        SISO, 2014</a>). Second, a scenario can be defined as a specification of
      conditions and situations to be represented by a simulation environment
      for its purpose (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Umu">Durak, Topcu,
        Siegfried, &amp; Oguztuzun, 2014</a>). Both definitions agree that a
      scenario is a description of important events and conditions needed to
      represent a specific order of events which, in this application, occurs
      within a simulation environment. Therefore, when developing a simulation
      environment which utilizes these events and conditions, it is often a
      prerequisite to define the scenarios that will be executed in the target
      simulation environment. This concept is known as scenario-based
      development.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO) released
      guidelines for the creation of simulation scenarios, detailed in (<a
        role="doc-biblioref" href="#NAT15">NATO Modelling and Simulation
        Group MSG-086, 2015</a>). The guideline provides detailed information
      regarding the development of simulation scenarios, including an overview
      of available tools and processes. According to (<a role="doc-biblioref"
        href="#GSD14">GSD Product Development Group, SISO, 2014</a>), a scenario
      must be well-defined and must be complete, consistent, and comprehensible.
      Failing to achieve these aspects can lead to incomplete scenario
      definition and misunderstanding regarding the scope and applications of
      the simulation environment. As a result, the subsequently designed
      simulation environment is prone to error and may not reflect what the user
      originally intended. For a simulation environment that is designed to
      execute a specific set of scenarios, this misunderstanding can be
      disastrous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scenario development is an important part of all phases of the simulation
      environment development process. It not only defines a specification of a
      simulation run, but also provides an input for the design and evaluation
      of the simulation environment itself (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Umu">Durak,
        Topcu, Siegfried, &amp; Oguztuzun, 2014</a>). Scenario development can be
      broken down into the creation of three scenario groups: (1) operational
      scenarios, (2) conceptual scenarios, and (3) executable scenarios. First,
      operational scenarios are provided by subject-matter experts (SMEs) in the
      early stages of development. These scenarios often provide a broad
      description of the desired events in textual form using natural language.
      For example, an operational scenario may describe what events occur during
      the simulation and in which order they should occur. Operational scenarios
      use domain-specific terminology to describe the events, which can then be
      identified by the Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) expert and
      incorporated into the simulation ontology. Operational scenarios must be
      identified before development of the simulation environment, as virtually
      all simulation requirements are derived from these scenarios. Second,
      although operational scenarios provide the simulation requirements, they
      are too broad to provide the details necessary to derive a conceptual
      model and create a simulation environment. A conceptual scenario adds this
      detail and additional information to the operational scenarios. These
      scenarios are often created by an M&amp;S expert in collaboration with an
      SME. Although similar to an operational scenario, conceptual scenarios
      should contain all information needed for the simulation environment. In
      addition, instead of a purely natural language approach, a conceptual
      scenario is used to create a conceptual model, which elaborates concepts
      into entities similar to UML classes. These entities contain properties
      and attributes which describe their roles and associations in the
      simulation environment. Finally, once the conceptual model is complete and
      the simulation environment is defined, executable scenarios can be made.
      An executable scenario is the specification of a specific situation
      providing all information necessary for preparation, initialization, and
      execution of a simulation environment (<a role="doc-biblioref"
        href="#GSD14">GSD Product Development Group, SISO, 2014</a>). These
      scenarios are ideally specified in a way that allows them to be
      machine-readable and reusable. These types of scenarios can be seen in <a
        href="#_Ref509500998">Figure 1</a>.

    <p>
      Durak et al. (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Umu">Durak, Topcu,
        Siegfried, &amp; Oguztuzun, 2014</a>) propose a model-driven engineering
      (MDE) approach to the scenario development process using the Eclipse
      Modeling Framework (EMF). Following MDE principles, scenario development
      is viewed as the transformation of operational scenarios (defined using
      natural language) to conceptual scenarios (conforming to a metamodel) to
      executable scenarios (specified using a scenario specification language)
      and simulation environment design (following a specific formalism). As the
      development process occurs, the scenario models are refined and
      transformed. As a result, the proposed method requires conceptual
      scenarios to be based on a metamodel which is then transformed into
      executable scenarios for target simulation environments using a set of
      rules specific to the target simulation environment. Following this method
      of model-to-model or model-to-text transformations, a conceptual scenario
      can be transformed into multiple executable scenarios for multiple target
      simulation environments. This greatly promotes reuse and simplicity among
      the M&amp;S community.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the scenario development process, each scenario should at least
      specify three main components: (1) the initial state, (2) the course of
      events, and (3) the termination conditions. As the scenario development
      process progresses, these three components should be further refined and
      expanded. The initial state describes the situation at the beginning of
      the scenario timeline and generally contains information such as date and
      time, surrounding conditions, and objects. The course of events describes
      any pre-planned events that occur at a specified time or in a specified
      order. These events can elicit a response, such as from a trainee using
      the system, or describe a change in entity association or state, such as
      an aircraft beginning a turn while en route. Events are often prompted by
      a trigger condition and each event injects changes to the simulation
      scenario state to achieve a desired effect or action. Any number of events
      can occur throughout the scenario timeline. The termination conditions
      describe the state of the simulation environment where the scenario can be
      defined as completed or terminated. This can occur via a specific event
      (such as a successful landing) or other means of measurement (such as
      achieving a predefined elapsed time) (<a role="doc-biblioref"
        href="#GSD14">GSD Product Development Group, SISO, 2014</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Scenario-based development and the scenario development process are
      complex and time-consuming. However, a variety of tools and standards
      exist to help alleviate these challenges. For operational scenarios, the
      Distributed Simulation Engineering and Execution Process (DSEEP) describes
      a generic 7-step process for developing and executing a simulation
      environment. DSEEP was used by Durak et al. (<a role="doc-biblioref"
        href="#Umu">Durak, Topcu, Siegfried, &amp; Oguztuzun, 2014</a>) when
      implementing the MDE approach to scenario development. The
      Coalition-Battle Management Language (C-BML) strives to provide a standard
      for specifying the course of events within a scenario. For conceptual
      scenarios, the Base Object Model (BOM) defines a standard for defining and
      reusing components of models, simulations, and federations. BOM can be
      used as a base for a simulation conceptual model and in the design of
      scenarios for interoperable simulations. For executable scenarios, the
      Military Scenario Definition Language (MSDL) is the most well-known
      standard for specifying executable scenarios in the military domain (<a
        role="doc-biblioref" href="#GSD14">GSD Product Development Group,
        SISO, 2014</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) Modeling and
      Simulation Technical Committee (MSTC) recently launched a working group
      towards the development of a standard simulation scenario definition
      language for the aviation domain. However, there are multitudes of
      challenges which are well introduced in (<a role="doc-biblioref"
        href="#Jaf171">Jafer &amp; Durak, 2017</a>). First to mention is the
      complexity of the aviation systems which comes from the large number of
      systems/subsystems involved, their deep hierarchical system structures,
      and complicated interrelations and inter-dependencies. Simulation scenario
      definition conclusively inherits this complexity. Additionally,
      variability of intended use adds another flavor to complexity. It
      corresponds to variability in systems modeling both in scope and
      resolution. As the structure and elements of the modeled air and ground
      systems vary, the simulation scenario definition also varies. For example,
      the elements of scenarios may largely differ between the simulations for
      air crew training and research into pilot vehicle interfaces. Therefore,
      we are conducting two parallel efforts for developing the simulation
      scenario definition language of aviation. First to mention, the Aviation
      Scenario Definition Language (ASDL), proposed by Jafer et. al. in 2016 (<a
        role="doc-biblioref" href="#Jaf161">2016</a>) utilizes the Web Ontology
      Language (OWL) and Eclipse Modeling Framework. The second one proposed by
      Durak et al. (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Dur17">2017</a>) utilizes
      System Entity Structure ontology. Durak et al. (<a role="doc-biblioref"
        href="#Dur18">2018</a>) claims that utilizing XML based approaches are
      key to achieve wide industry acceptance of the standard simulation
      scenario definition language. Here in this paper we illustrate how
      equivalent schema for a scenario definition language can be constructed
      using both OWL ontology and SES based approaches.

      <h1>Domain-Specific Languages</h1>
      <p>Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are computer languages tailored to
        a specific application domain. As a result, DSLs are often more
        expressive for that particular domain, offering ease of use. This allows
        domain experts, who may not be familiar with programming and
        general-purpose programming languages, to use a DSL to express ideas and
        concepts in their domain, which is commonly not possible otherwise.</p>
      <p>
        DSL development is incredibly difficult as it requires knowledge of the
        domain and language development expertise, of which few people have
        both. As a result, the creation of a DSL is often not considered and if
        so, a DSL rarely evolves into a full-fledged language which can be used
        within the domain it is intended for (<a role="doc-biblioref"

        An ontology describes the concepts and relationships that are important
        in a particular domain and provides a vocabulary for that domain via a
        computerized specification of the meaning of terms used in the
        vocabulary (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Zho09">Yao &amp; Zhang,
          2009</a>). Ontologies bridge the gap between people and systems, as
        ontologies describe domain relationships and objects in an easily
        understood manner while maintaining the ability to be machine
        interpretable. As a result, ontologies allow both people and computers
        to understand and derive new knowledge about the domain in question (<a
          role="doc-biblioref" href="#Bar08">Putten, Wolfe, &amp; Dignum,
          2008</a>). Therefore, ontologies can be used as a starting point for
        further development as a domain expands or the ontology embraces new or
        additional concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a popular format for creating and
        sharing an ontology. OWL is a semantic markup language for publishing
        and sharing ontologies on the web. It extends the Resource Description
        Framework (RDF) vocabulary and enables describing a domain in terms of
        classes, properties, and individuals (<a role="doc-biblioref"

      <h1>Aviation Scenario Definition Language</h1>
      <p>
        First proposed by Jafer et. al. in 2016 (<a role="doc-biblioref"
          href="#Jaf161">2016</a>), the Aviation Scenario Definition Language
        (ASDL) provides a simple, standardized method for aviation scenario
        generation from a model-driven perspective. ASDL aims to provide a
        common mechanism for verifying and executing aviation scenarios, allow
        for effective sharing of scenarios among various simulation
        environments, improve the consistency of different simulators and
        simulations, and enable the reuse of scenario specifications. By
        creating a common, standardized language for defining aviation
        scenarios, the duplicate effort often seen in the aviation simulation
        scenario generation process can be avoided. Developed in the Eclipse
        Modeling Framework (EMF), ASDL is a DSL currently supports four major
        categories of flight operation scenarios: departure, en route, reroute,
        and landing, as well as air traffic management concepts such as
        controller-pilot communication (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Chh18">Chhaya,
          Jafer, Coyne, Thigpen, &amp; Durak, 2018</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        The creation of ASDL and ASDL scenarios follows three major steps: (1)
        ASDL-specific ontology creation, (2) EMF definition and metamodel
        creation, and (3) design and implementation of a scenario in the
        instantiated model. The ASDL ontology is comprised primarily of key
        terminology defined by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), as
        well as procedures and operations that are communicated between the
        pilot and air traffic control (ATC). All ontology terms currently
        included in ASDL were obtained from (<a role="doc-biblioref"
          href="#FAA93">Federal Aviation Administration, 1995</a>), (<a
          role="doc-biblioref" href="#SES">SESAR, 2018</a>), and (<a
          role="doc-biblioref" href="#Fed12">Federal Aviation
          Administration, 2012</a>). In the interest of reusability, the ASDL
        ontology focuses on all aspects of a flight, including the physical
        aircraft, ATC communications and procedures, and pilot communications
        and procedures. By including such aspects, the ontology can be used in
        all forms of aviation simulators, including ATC simulators and pilot
        training simulators.

      <h1>SES</h1>
      <p>
        A fundamental representation of Discrete Event System Specification
        (DEVS)(<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Ber00">Zeigler B. P., 2000</a>)
        hierarchical modular model structures is the System Entity Structure
        (SES) (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Ber84">Zeigler B. P., 1984</a>)
        which represents a design space via the elements of a system and their
        relationships in a hierarchical and axiomatic manner. SES is a
        declarative knowledge representation scheme that characterizes the
        structure of a family of models in terms of decompositions, component
        taxonomies, and coupling specifications and constraints. The SES is a
        formal ontology framework, axiomatically defined, to represent the
        elements of a system (or world) and their relationships in hierarchical
        manner making a family of hierarchical DEVS models (<a

      <p>Entities represent things that have existence in a certain domain.
        They can have variables which are assigned a value within a given range
        and type. An Aspect expresses a way of decomposing an object into more
        detailed parts and is a labeled decomposition relation between the
        parent and the children. MultiAspects are aspects for which the
        components are all of the same kind. A Specialization represents a
        category or family of specific forms that a thing can assume. It is a
        labeled relation that expresses alternative choices that a system entity
        can take on.</p>

    <h1>ASDL Ontology</h1>
    <p>
      All ontology terms currently included in ASDL were obtained from documents
      available through the FAA and European aviation programs (<a
        role="doc-biblioref" href="#FAA93">Federal Aviation Administration,
        1995</a>). The ASDL ontology focuses on all aspects of a flight, including
      the physical aircraft, ATC communications and procedures, and pilot
      communications and procedures. By including such aspects, the ASDL
      ontology can be used in all forms of aviation simulators, including ATC
      simulators and pilot training simulators.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ontology consists of two parts: keywords that describe the physical
      model and operation of flights, and words that describe key communication
      between the control tower and pilots. Over 100 keywords can be found on
      the basic ontology created using Protégé (<a role="doc-biblioref"
        href="#Emh13">Alatrish, 2013</a>), which saves them in OWL format. The
      Web Ontology Language (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Bec09">Bechhofer,
        2009</a>) is a language for defining ontologies on the Web. An OWL ontology
      describes a domain in terms of classes, properties and individuals and may
      include rich descriptions of the characteristics of those objects (<a
        role="doc-biblioref" href="#Pro">Protégé Home Page, 2018</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      An ontology focuses mainly on classes which describe the concepts of the
      domain. It follows a hierarchical model where subclasses are all
      necessarily a part of the superclass (<a role="doc-biblioref"
        href="#Nat011">Noy &amp; McGuinness, 2001</a>). The ASDL ontology has
      four base classes: Air_Traffic_Control, Aircraft, Airport, and Weather.
      This can be seen in <a href="#_Ref448318380">Figure 3</a> below. All these
      terms have been defined in <a href="#_Ref509502629">Table 1</a>.

      The main part of this ontology involves the aircraft and its properties. <a
        href="#_Ref448318942">Figure 4</a> shows the subclasses of the Aircraft
      class. The Flight_Properties subclass describes the rules (IFR or VFR)
      that govern the flight, the speed of the aircraft, the fuel remaining and
      has three other subclasses: controls (pitch, roll and turn rates),
      location (altitude, latitude, longitude) and time (arrival time, departure
      time and Actual Calculated Landing Time). The physical properties subclass
      contains the call sign, type of aircraft and its weight class.

    <p>
      This ontology has been extended over time, with the departure extension
      being added first, followed by the en route and reroute extensions,
      respectively. This resulted in a language composition following an <q>inside-out</q>
      approach, with the landing and departure phases being completed first,
      followed by the <q>middle</q> en route and reroute extensions. This
      approach made it easier to determine missing components from both the
      landing and departure stages, as inserting the middle extension was not
      possible unless all components from both the landing and departure stages
      were complete and accounted for. In addition, this approach allowed for <q>ignoring</q>
      the more complicated components of flight, such as airspace
      classifications and identification, until both the landing and departure
      phases were implemented. This greatly simplified the already complicated
      additions needed for completing the en route and reroute extensions, which
      needed to modify the original ASDL structure.
    </p>
    <p>The addition of three extensions resulted in only doubling the
      ontology, not tripling. This is because many terms already defined in the
      original ASDL ontology could be reused in the other phases of flight. This
      is common in aviation, where terms that are defined can span multiple
      phases of flights or domains. Therefore, it is believed that as further
      extensions are added to ASDL, the number of additional ontology terms
      needed to complete each extension may gradually decrease. This, in turn,
      suggests that future ASDL extensions can be added faster than previous
      extensions, given the future additions remain in a similar domain and/or
      subject area as the previous ones.</p>
    <section>
      <h1>Departure Extension Ontology</h1>
      <p>The departure extension was similar to the original ASDL
        implementation in that both phases of flight involved an aircraft,
        pilot, and air traffic controller and their interactions in an airport
        environment. As a result, only a few additional ontology terms were
        needed to create a departure scenario. However, some additional terms
        were added for robustness in both the landing and departure scenarios,
        such as the weight properties of the aircraft.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="#_Ref505119809">Figure 5</a> shows the departure ontology terms
        added to the Air Traffic Control class of ASDL ontology. Note that some
        terms, such as Abort, are from the original ASDL ontology and do not
        reflect additions made for the departure extension; terms that were
        added in this extension are highlighted in red. These terms are used by
        air traffic control when communicating with a departing aircraft and
        provide additional control options. For example, the Line Up and Wait
        term is not required for every departure but can be used by ATC at
        airports with heavy traffic in order to expedite the departure process.

        the aircraft’s maximum takeoff weight and the proposed departure time.
        In addition, the Pilot subclass was updated to contain an additional
        option a pilot may request during the departure phase.

      <h1>En Route Extension Ontology</h1>
      <p>The en route extension introduced the concept of airspace and how
        aircraft move through different parts of an airspace. This required a
        variety of changes to the original ASDL ontology, which previously did
        not extend beyond a tower controller and airport airspace. As a result,
        a large amount of new terms was needed, especially in the ATC class. In
        addition, a new Airspace class was added in order to capture the
        movement of the aircraft through different parts of an airspace during
        the en route phase.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="#_Ref505095165">Figure 7</a> shows the en route ontology terms
        added to the Air Traffic Control class of ASDL ontology. These terms are
        used by air traffic control when communicating with an aircraft in the
        en route phase and provide additional control options. For example, the
        Traffic Alert term is not required for every aircraft in the en route
        phase but can be used by ATC if another aircraft may break the
        separation minima required between aircraft.

        <a href="#_Ref505095050">Figure 8</a> shows the Aircraft class updated
        with the en route terms. These terms define aircraft-specific components
        during the en route phase of flight, such as Miles-in-Trail, which is
        used by ATC for enforcing separation minima between two cruising
        aircraft.

    <h1>SES for Ontological Representation</h1>
    <p>
      The ontological representation of ASDL elements using SES is discussed in
      this section. The methodology of creating this schema representation was
      the same as that used to create the OWL ontology, and the data has been
      gathered from the same sources. The ontological details have been shown in
      tree-structure for better visualization. <a href="#_Ref505205871">Figure

      A scenario encapsulates the Environment in which all interaction takes
      place, the Entities that perform tasks or interact with each other and the
      Events that are triggered. The three main Entities are Aircraft, Airport
      and Airspace. The Aircraft entity can be seen in full in <a

      The Airspace entity contains a number of sectors, which contain several
      Air Traffic Centers (ATCs), which have a facility name, a type of center
      (such as Air Route Traffic Control Center for en route control, tower and
      terminal radar approach control). This has been shown in <a

    <p>
      In addition to Entities, a Scenario also contains Events. These describe
      the changes to the Environment or Entity and their effects on the other
      elements of the Scenario. The changes in the state of an aircraft during
      flight are recorded using State Machines. <a href="#_Ref505117845">Figure

    <h1>Sample En Route Scenario</h1>
    <p>The use of both forms of the ASDL Ontology can be illustrated by
      defining a sample scenario using each method. An en route scenario
      describes the aircraft’s progression through airspace from the departure
      climb to the arrival descent. The en route scenario is defined as follows:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Aircraft ER-1357 has departed from the Daytona Beach International
        Airport (KDAB) via runway 7L. ER-1357 will be landing on runway 29 at
        the Gainesville airport (KGNV). Stable weather conditions nearing
        Daytona Beach are reported as calm winds, dew point: 23, sky condition:
        scattered clouds at 5500 feet, temperature: 15, visibility: 10. ER-1357
        begins climbing and heads direct to the Ormond VOR (OMN). Daytona
        departure ATC grants ER-1357 to climb to 8000 feet and tells ER-1357 to
        proceed along the route as filed. ER-1357 begins to climb to 8000 feet.
        After passing OMN, ER-1357 joins airway T207-208. At CARRA, Daytona
        departure hands off ER-1357 to Jacksonville approach. ER-1357 turns west
        to join T208, heading towards KGNV. Once within 30 miles of KGNV,
        Jacksonville approach control contacts ER-1357 and the landing phase
        begins.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The state diagram for the en route extension is shown in <a
        href="#_Ref505205239">Figure 17</a>. During the en route phase of
      flight, the aircraft spends a majority of its time in the Cruise state,
      where the aircraft’s location on the route is constantly updating. At any
      time during the Cruise state, an aircraft may turn, climb, or descend as
      necessary to avoid traffic, follow the designated route, or as commanded
      by ATC. After arriving within approach range of the destination, the
      aircraft transitions into the landing phase, thereby ending the en route
      phase.

      <h1>SES En Route Scenario Implementation</h1>
      <p>
        The SES implementation allows for the same information to be entered
        which is present in the EMF metamodel. However, it implements it using
        an XML schema extracted from the tree structure of SES shown in <a
          href="#_Ref505210321">Figure 16</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the given SES tree consisting of all possible elements of the
        simulation scenario, the scenario modeling activity requires pruning of
        this tree to hand pick a very particular scenario. Pruning is defined as
        assigning the values to the variables and resolving the choices in
        Aspect, Multi-Aspect and Specialization relations. While there may be
        several Aspect nodes for several decompositions of the system on the
        same hierarchical level, a particular subset can be chosen in pruning
        based on the purpose. The resulting selection-free tree is the model
        representation of that particular scenario. The pruned version of the
        SES representation has been shown for an en route scenario in <a
          href="#_Ref505212183">Figure 20</a>.

        The elements shown for the EMF model in <a href="#_Ref509500629">Figure
          19</a> are implemented in this pruned SES ontology to obtain the same type
        of graphical representation. The figure does not include all the

        ASDL. The state machine for this scenario using SES is seen in <a

    <h1>ASDL Standardization</h1>
    <p>A well-known problem in the aviation simulation community is the
      complexity of simulators and variety in simulator designs. This commonly
      results in individual implementations of scenarios which work only on a
      specific simulator system. Standardization of ASDL creates a more
      accessible means of defining aviation scenarios which are reusable, easier
      to understand, and reduce error through reduced complexity. By following
      the Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO)
      standardization guidelines and procedure, ASDL can become a full-fledged
      standard providing a general, stable, and supported means of defining
      scenarios for use in aviation in ways that are not limited to a specific
      simulator design.</p>
    <section>
      <h1>SISO Standardization Process</h1>
      <p>
        SISO is an international organization dedicated to the promotion of
        interoperability and reuse in the M&amp;S community (<a
          role="doc-biblioref" href="#Sim17">Simulation Interoperability
          Standards Organization, 2017</a>). SISO publishes a variety of standards
        which strive to meet this goal in a variety of simulation domains,
        including analysis, research and development, testing and evaluation,
        and training. These standards provide a common base for creating
        reusable simulation components. However, becoming a SISO standard is not
        an easy task. SISO standards need to be stable, well understood,
        technically competent, have multiple independent interoperable
        implementations, be well received by the community, and be recognizably
        useful to the M&amp;S community (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Sim172">Simulation
          Interoperability Standards Organization, 2017</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a six-step process to becoming a SISO standard: (1) Activity
        Approval, (2) Product Development, (3) Forming Balloting Group and
        Product Balloting, (4) Product Approval, (5) Interpretation,
        Distribution and Configuration Management, and (6) Periodic Review.
        After being nominated to become a SISO standard, the product must apply
        for formal SISO approval. The proposal may be based on work previously
        done by an external organization. If the proposal is approved, the
        product begins development, following SISO standards, by a Product
        Development Group (PDG), which is assigned to the project. The PDG then
        presents the status of the product for approval to begin balloting to
        become a full-fledged standard. If more work on the product is needed,
        it goes back to the product development step. Otherwise, it moves into
        product approval. If the product demonstrates adherence to SISO
        principles for inclusion as a SISO standard, it is accepted by a
        committee. Once approved, a Product Support Group (PSG) takes
        responsibility of the product and handles the distribution and
        configuration management for the product and provides support to the
        community for the product. Finally, the PSG will periodically review
        each product to ensure they are still relevant to the community and they
        continue to meet SISO requirements (<a role="doc-biblioref"
          href="#Sim173">Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization,
          2017</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2008, the Military Scenario Definition Language (MSDL) standard was
        accepted and published as a SISO standard. Reaffirmed in 2015, this
        standard defined an XML-based language for defining military scenarios.
        The intent of MSDL was to create a general and reusable method of
        creating and verifying military scenarios, improve consistency among
        scenarios, and create reuse of scenarios between different simulators
        through a standard scenario language format (<a role="doc-biblioref"
          href="#Sim08">Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization,
          2008</a>).
      </p>
      <p>ASDL was created with MSDL as a source of inspiration, as both
        languages share a similar domain of scenario generation and application.
        However, ASDL addresses scenario generation for the aviation domain,
        which is not addressed or supported through MSDL. Similar to the MSDL,
        ASDL is defined using an XML schema that allows for format
        standardization and content verification. This definition of ASDL should
        be used towards applying for SISO standardization.</p>

      <h1>DSL Standardization Challenges</h1>
      <p>
        In addition to being incredibly difficult to create, DSLs are also
        difficult to standardize. An examination of the Battle Management
        Language (BML) standardization efforts identified three major problems
        that can delay or inhibit the standardization of a domain language: (1)
        the technical readiness, (2) the need for a deliberate process, and (3)
        the adequacy of resources to pursue standard development. After over
        five years of standardization efforts, BML was still unable to be
        accepted as a SISO standard. One of the major factors in this result was
        the lack of technical readiness. Technical readiness includes the need
        for multi-disciplined support and multiple perspectives, technology
        advancement, and emergent requirements. BML is a wide-spread,
        large-scope language that requires a vast amount of technical expertise
        across a variety of domains, including all branches of the military. In
        addition, as technology continued to mature, BML requirements and the
        systems used by BML changed. For example, while attempting to
        standardize BML, the underlying data model was continually updated and
        revised, leading to inconsistencies and issues with the standardization.
        These problems significantly delayed the standardization process for
        BML. In addition to technical readiness issues, BML was required by the
        SISO standardization process to follow a deliberate process which proved
        the need for and competency of the language. However, this was
        incredibly difficult to achieve for a project of this size and style.
        BML was being developed piecemeal, by contributors and volunteers from
        all over the world. This distributed development style led to copious
        misunderstandings and trust issues amongst the team. The team became
        fractured and meaningful development slowed to a crawl. The team also
        lacked resources to achieve the goal of standardization. While
        volunteers keep the costs of development lower, it can lead to issues in
        motivation and drive. As a result, the development schedule can suffer
        from a lack of direction and motivation from a single driving point,
        such as a sponsor. In addition, because SISO standards strive for
        openness and accessibility, tension was created between leaders trying
        to drive a project forward and those implementing the project. A strong
        understanding of the technical domain and a homogeneous team culture are
        necessary to avoid these fatal standardization problems (<a
          role="doc-biblioref" href="#Abb11">Abbot, Pullen, &amp; S., 2011</a>).

    <h1>Discussion and Future Work</h1>
    <p>
      This paper examined the ontological development of ASDL using two
      different methods. For the first, the ontology was created in the OWL
      format using an open-source ontology editor called Protégé. This ontology
      was then used to create an EMF metamodel of the language and an XML schema
      was produced using automated model transformations and code generation. In
      the other approach, the ontology was defined in the form of SES entities
      and relationships. This tree structure of SES was used to obtain the XML
      schema. The XML script of a sample en route scenario was obtained using
      both methods and found to be identical. However, as the results are
      indistinguishable, both approaches are valid and suited to the purpose of
      creating a scenario definition language in aviation. A comparison of the
      two approaches has been presented in <a href="#_Ref509502691">Table 2</a>.

    </table>
    <p>It was found that entities and relationships are required at the
      start to define a scenario using both approaches. The specification format
      for OWL is hierarchical, whereas SES follows more rigid guidelines and
      restrictions in the definition of entities, aspects and specializations.
      The EMF ontology is in a standard web ontology language format (.owl
      file), whereas the SES is in a graphical format. An OWL file requires an
      additional tool to open and edit the file, while working with SES can be
      done using any graphical editor. However, due to the specialized
      structure, an understanding of SES is required to comprehend and edit
      these files. The authors found that the SES approach did not require the
      additional step of transforming the ontological details into an EMF model,
      but rather required its definition using an XML tool. It also removed the
      dependency on the Eclipse framework during the development stage.
      Ultimately, both approaches produced an identical scenario in XML format.
    </p>
    <p>As ASDL is still in its infancy, the next step is to expand the
      language to describe scenarios in better detail than is currently
      possible. The language needs to be extended to cover a wider variety of
      scenarios such as flight training, air traffic controller training, and
      unmanned vehicle flight. This work done for ASDL is a stepping stone to
      the standardization of the language as a method for defining aviation
      scenarios. The process for standardizing such a language has been
      described here along with some of the challenges facing this effort.</p>
