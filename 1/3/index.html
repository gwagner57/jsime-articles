    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <p>Simulations have been used in multiple fields. Social simulation, in
      which humans play a major role in simulated scenarios, is one of the most
      promising fields in research. Human behavior is difficult to
      mathematically formulate. This makes it challenging to determine how well
      simulations mimic real situations; confirming simulation results
      empirically is also difficult. In this study, we present a new device that
      could change human behavior and provide a good method for mitigating
      damages during emergencies. We also consider ways of validating the
      simulation results to assess the new technology adoption.</p>

  <section id="sect1">
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Disasters may occur anywhere at any time. In the past, we have been
      preparing for disasters in order to reduce the damage caused by them (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#WHO02">World Health Organization [WHO],
        2002</a>). Weather forecast is one of the most common methods to foresee and
      plan for disasters such as heavy rainfall, typhoon, earthquakes, and other
      natural occurrences. The forecast is used to predict weather that may
      affect human life. Conditions under which disasters occur are
      wide-ranging; in the case of typhoons, news of a typhoon is announced a
      few days prior, while alerts on earthquakes are announced minutes before
      they occur at most. Prevention planning is executed to save lives during
      foreseen disasters, and drills are performed to improve the effectiveness
      of plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plans for disasters are designed to be equivalent to the most extreme
      cases of past disasters, or worse ones. It is ideal to perform drills in
      the assumed situations. However, even statutory training in real
      situations can create risks, especially for disabled people and some
      vulnerable groups. For example, a university in Nairobi, Kenya executed an
      anti-terror exercise without announcing it was a drill. People believed it
      was real and several of them jumped from the windows of the university
      buildings and were injured (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#BBC15">BBC
        News, 2015</a>). Therefore, drills are executed at least under the basic
      condition that participants know it is a drill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Computer simulations enable the examination of new scenarios that have not
      occurred in the real world. Social simulation, in which human behavior
      plays a major role in the simulated scenarios, is one of the most
      promising fields of simulation. Humans behave individually during
      emergencies; this behavior is difficult to mathematically formulate
      effectively. Therefore, it is challenging to determine how well
      simulations mimic real world situations. The development of Information
      Technology (IT) has inspired the introduction of new means to provide
      information to the public, especially travelers, and change human behavior
      to mitigate damages during emergencies (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#FHA07">Federal Highway Administration [FHA], 2007</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      An agent-based simulation system (ABSS) can simulate the behaviors of
      people in unusual scenarios that are difficult to test in the real world.
      People activities and movements have been simulated and studied in various
      fields including computer graphics, movie special effects, and evacuation.
      For example, the influence of the existence of authority figures or agent
      characters on the evacuation behaviors was simulated (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Son17">Song, 2017</a>; <a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Son16">Song, 2016</a>; <a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Oka11">Okaya &amp; Toakahashi, 2011</a>).
      However, the results of simulations were not verified as pointed out,
      unlike physics-based models, models and results of social simulations are
      not readily verified through observation of real-world events or empirical
      testing (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Hei">Hahn, 2013</a>). The human
      behavior in the simulations has been modeled using the reports on target
      fields (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#GIH12">Hawe, Coates, Wilson,
        &amp; Crouch, 2012</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      In this paper, we discuss ways to assess a new method of evacuating people
      in life-threatening situations by simulation. The field of evacuation
      considers the case that humans are a component of the system. The
      remainder of this paper is set out as follows: In <a href="#sect2">Section
        2</a>, the steps to model phenomena in the real world are presented. <a href="#sect3">Section 3</a> describes a new evacuation guidance system
      using digital promotional signage (<span class="math-span">𝑃𝑆</span>)
      that has been recently used in public and commercial areas. The effects of
      evacuation guidance on human evacuation flow control are tested using
      simulation, and the experimental results are discussed. In <a href="#sect4">Section 4</a>, the ways of assessment of simulation
      results are discussed. <a href="#sect5">Section 5</a> provides a
      descriptive summary of our paper.

      <h1>Modeling Phenomena and Framework of Simulation</h1>
      <p>
        Simulations have been used in many fields for various purposes. The
        application fields are categorized into three classes: the first class
        consists of fields that are governed by scientific laws, the second
        class consists of fields that are related with humans. The human
        behaviors are not easily mathematically formulated but are represented
        in terms of text or data in documents. The third class is a combination
        of the first and the second. <a href="#_Ref511746582">Figure 1</a> shows
        a process of modeling phenomena that belong in the first class. The
        phenomena are observed and represented as <span class="math-span">𝐷
          <sub>𝑠<sup>𝑖</sup></sub> = (𝑠<sup>𝑖</sup>, 𝑑<sup>𝑖</sup>)
        </span> where <span class="math-span">𝑑<sub>𝑖</sub></span> is the data of the
        <span class="math-span">𝑖<sup>th</sup></span> observation at situation
        <span class="math-span">𝑠<sup>𝑖</sup></span>. Modeling of phenomena
        involves extracting parameters <span class="math-span">𝑐<sub>𝑖</sub></span>
        and the relationships among them, <span class="math-span">𝐹<sub>𝑖</sub></span>
        calculates the phenomena from <span class="math-span">𝐷<sub>𝑠<sup>𝑖</sup></sub></span>
        and the validity is checked. To check validity, we determine whether the
        derived outputs from <span class="math-span">𝐹<sub>𝑖</sub></span>
        correspond to observed data, <span class="math-span">𝑑<sup>𝑖</sup></span>
        (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#MFa">Faraday, 1848</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        An example of the first class is physics. Physics is an empirical
        science and physical laws have been derived based on the principle:
        guess → compute consequence → compare experiment. When new phenomena are
        observed, more specific laws are developed by adding new parameters,
        reformulating relationships between them, and so on to achieve higher
        reliability (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#RPF67">Feynman, 1967</a>).
        The simulation results are used in fields within the applicable scope of
        the physical laws.

      <p>
        Humans are a key component of social activities. These activities are
        the target field of classes two and three that we discussed earlier.
        Human behaviors that are described in texts or are documented as audio
        recording are implemented in simulations. The use of agent technology
        provides a platform to simulate social phenomena arising from the human
        activities (i.e., micro-behavior). The micro-specific approach has been
        accepted to solve complex real-world problems in various areas. For
        example, Jennings proposed a framework called <em>Social Level</em>, in
        which multi-agent systems (MAS) are targeted at systems composed of
        societies (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Jen99">Jennings, 1999</a>).
        The society possesses the following components:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Members</em>: entities performing the problem solving,
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Environment</em>: where members are situated,
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Means of interaction</em>: the ways members interact, and
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Goals</em>: a motivational force that drives problem solving
            among members.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The modeling process for the second and the third classes of
        applications essentially follows the modeling process displayed in <a href="#_Ref511746582">Figure 1</a>. However, each member’s autonomous
        behaviors and interactions with other members are different because of
        the diversity of culture and generation. The diversity makes it
        difficult to verify and validate the results (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Hea09">Heath, Hill, &amp; Ciarallo, 2009</a>).

      <h1>Social Simulation to Prepare Prevention Planning for Disasters</h1>
      <p>
        Emergency situations arise from various causes and people behave
        differently during emergencies; for example, when there is an alarm to
        evacuate immediately, some people evacuate instantly and others may
        evacuate only after finishing their tasks. Various disasters such as
        fires, floods, typhoons, earthquakes, etc., occur at situations of
        different size, occurrence times, and so on. Kitano et al. (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Kit99">1999</a>) proposed a MAS-based
        social simulation platform, RoboCup Rescue Simulation (RCRS) to support
        rescue activities during disastrous situations. <a href="#_Ref511747742">Figure
          2</a> shows the modeling process and the flowchart of simulators that can
        simulate disaster situations in various cases and scenarios (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Tak09">Takahashi, 2009</a>).

        In the event of an earthquake and consequent fire, the spread of fires
        and the collapse of buildings, roads and other infrastructures are
        simulated by <span class="math-span">𝐹<sup>1</sup></span> and <span class="math-span">𝐹<sup>𝑛</sup></span>, respectively. Pedestrian
        dynamics calculate the movements of humans in these areas. Each <span class="math-span">𝐹</span> is a model of a disaster case that is
        derived according to the process of <a href="#_Ref511746582">Figure
          1</a>. The superscript corresponds to the disaster and the subscript
        represents the situation. For example, even if the fires occur in the
        same area, the damages from the disasters are different depending on
        when they occur or how many people are present. The damages from <span class="math-span">𝐹<sup>𝑖</sup></span> are integrated to simulate
        composite disaster situations. The entanglement is based on the
        following hypotheses.
      </p>
      <p>
        H1:(whole-part relation) A social system, <span class="math-span">∑</span>,
        may be composed of subsystems, <span class="math-span">𝑆<sup>𝑖</sup></span>.
        Everyone has some knowledge on phenomena; social systems simulate this,
        and the knowledge is implemented in <span class="math-span">𝑆<sup>𝑖</sup></span>.
        The model has a finite set of parameters, <span class="math-span">∏
          = {𝑝<sub>1</sub>, 𝑝<sub>2</sub>, …, 𝑝<sub>𝑛</sub>}
        </span>. The parameters, <span class="math-span">𝑝<sub>𝑖</sub></span>,
        represent features of agents, environments, and the interactions among
        them or others.
      </p>
      <p>
        H2:(causality of system) The procedure followed in the system is
        described by formulas or rules. In the case of a discrete-time dynamic
        system, it can be described as <span class="math-span">∑<sub>t+1</sub>
          = 𝐹(∑<sub>t</sub>, ∏<sub>t</sub>)
        </span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        H3:(validness of system) When subsystems, <span class="math-span">𝑆<sup>𝑖</sup></span>,
        are well defined, then the system, <span class="math-span">∑</span>
        may be well designed and expanding or refining parameters and functions
        can cover more phenomena.

      <p>
        <span class="math-span">𝑇<sub>𝑝</sub></span> which represents
        emergency situations that arise from various factors and human behaviors
        are involved in computing <span class="math-span">∑</span>. The
        result of <span class="math-span">∑</span> are also compared with
        the precedent cases to verify the simulation results. The mitigation
        planning during future emergencies is formalized as finding conditions <span class="math-span">𝑐<sub>𝑖</sub></span> (related to damage) to
        minimize the damages by calculating <span class="math-span">𝐹(𝑠<sub>𝑖</sub>,
          𝑐<sub>𝑖</sub>)
        </span>. <span class="math-span">𝑐<sub>𝑖</sub></span> and corresponding

        Many people gather to watch games, exhibitions, political rallies, and
        other activities. For example, millions of pilgrims visit Mecca, Saudi
        Arabia during the same period every year. Although careful designs and
        operational plans have been made to ensure safe, secure and efficient
        movement of people in such crowded areas, the congestion of people has
        resulted in several disasters (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Tun">Tunasar,
          2013</a>). Crowd control is important to prevent disasters from occurring
        and to promote evacuation during emergencies.

        The <span class="math-span">𝐸𝑆</span> and the map are assumed to be
        suitable media to prompt evacuations in public space. In 1986 and 2011,
        questionnaire surveys were conducted on individuals asking, <q>What
          points do you feel anxious about in emergency situations?</q>, and <q>How
          do you behave when a fire occurs?</q> (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Abe88">Abe, Misumi, &amp; Okabe, 1988</a>; <a role="doc-biblioref" href="#TFD18">Tokyo Fire Department [TFD],

        reports contain similar observations in unfamiliar places, most people
        follow guidance from the public announcement (PA) system and from people
        around them.

      <h1>Preliminary Surveys for Validating Effectiveness of the Proposed
        System</h1>
      <p>
        People seem to move without paying attention to signs until something
        unexpected happens, after which their behavior becomes unpredictable. To
        validate the effectiveness of the proposed system, we surveyed to
        determine whether people sufficiently notice signs in general. Two
        questionnaire surveys: test A and test B. were conducted at a subway
        mall in 2016 (<a href="#_Ref513457790">Figure 5</a>). The mall is 300 m
        length long, located underground, and has fourteen exits to the surface
        and adjacent buildings. The exits were numbered as shown in <a href="#_Ref513457790">Figure 5</a>. The images in the top half of the
        figure show the inside of the mall and were taken at circled-mark points
        in the afternoon. The subjects of the tests were different groups of our
        students at our university, who were asked to walk normally to exit
        number 7 in the mall along the route displayed in <a href="#_Ref513457790">Figure 5</a> on different days. At the end of
        the route, they were asked to recall the number and the locations of <span class="math-span">𝐸𝑆</span> and digital <span class="math-span">𝑃𝑆</span>
        that they spotted. In test A, participants were subsequently asked to
        retrace their path and count the number attentively; this corresponds to
        real emergency situations when we look for <span class="math-span">𝐸𝑆</span>
        during evacuation. A shopping event was held while performing test B,
        therefore, seven more <span class="math-span">𝑃𝑆</span> were displayed
        than there was in test A.

            People noticed at most 30% of <span class="math-span">𝐸𝑆</span>

            number of signs when they were attentive.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            There was little difference in the perception rates between the
            proportion of <span class="math-span">𝐸𝑆</span> and <span class="math-span">𝑃𝑆</span> noticed.

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This indicates that <span class="math-span">𝑃𝑆</span> is assumed to
        function as <span class="math-span">𝐸𝑆</span> in an emergency and more

      <h1>Validation of Hypothesis by Simulation Results</h1>
      <p>
        Evacuations from the mall are simulated by an ABSS, TENDENKO (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Oka11">Okaya &amp; Takahashi, 2011</a>).
        TENDENKO has been developed based on RCRS and it can simulate evacuation
        behaviors from multistory buildings. Social force model is used to
        calculate human motions during the evacuation (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Hel02">Helbing, Farkas, Molnár &amp; Vixsek, 2002</a>). The
        rescue management office can provide information for people to evacuate
        through PA and signs, and agents can hear public announcements and see
        the signs around them. In every simulation step, the agents perceive the
        data around them, select an action to achieve their goal from a set of
        prescribed actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The effect of our CCEG is tested by simulating the following scenarios.
        Agents evacuate initially from the exit announced by the PA. The first
        message of PA is <q>Fire near exit number 1, evacuate from exit
          number 7</q>. This message is sent to all agents, and the agents follow
        the message. As time passes, CCEG displays new information on some PAs.
        The information is set suitable for dynamically changing situations, and
        the message is <q>Go to the nearest exit. The number of exit X</q>; the
        agents within 10 m can see the message. Some of the agents change their
        goal and go the exit X according to the new message, while others do not
        and go to the previous goal, the exit number 7.
      </p>
      <p>
        The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) published a
        technical report on occupant behavior during evacuation from a fire
        emergency (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#ISO09">ISO, 2009</a>). The
        technical report addresses parameters in designing for life safety and
        assessment the condition of occupants of the building with respect to
        time. The building parameters include floor layouts, warning systems,
        etc. The parameters of occupants are the number of occupants, their
        locations in the building, etc. Two basic values: available safe-escape
        time and required safe-escape time, which are taken by occupants to
        evacuate from buildings, are chosen to evaluate prevention plans against
        fire.
      </p>
      <p>We used the evacuation rate, which shows how many people have
        evacuated, as a parameter to evaluate new proposals with three changing
        parameters:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <span class="math-span">𝑝</span> is the rate of agents who follow
            the guidance. We observed that some agents evacuated immediately,
            while others did not even though they heard the announcements of
            evacuation (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Cab11">Cabinet Office
              Government of Japan, 2011</a>).

          <p>
            <span class="math-span">𝑛</span> is the number of people who are at

            corresponds roughly to one person per <span class="math-span">1m<sup>2</sup></span>.

          In each simulation, the behavior of the agents was recorded. The time
          when the agents arrived at exits and the number of agents who
          evacuated were calculated at each simulation time from the log files.
          The vertical axis of each graph is the average of evacuation rates of
          three simulations and the horizontal axis is simulation time. For
          example, about 30% of the agents evacuate at 30 time-step in a case of
          <span class="math-span">(𝑝, 𝑛, 𝑠) = (30%, 1000, 4)</span> of the
          top left chart in <a href="#_Ref513458319">Figure 6</a>. The survey
          results shown in <a href="#_Ref511750109">Table 1</a> indicated 30% of

            = 1000</span> correspond to congestions of a midweek afternoon. Hence, the

          was selected as a standard case.

        <p>
          The evacuation rate of the case with <span class="math-span">(𝑝,

          at 30 time-step, and the 95% confidence interval of the t-test becomes
          from 28% to 33%. The evacuation rates at 30 time-steps for the other
          15 cases with different <span class="math-span">𝑛</span> and <span class="math-span">𝑠</span> are outside of the confidence intervals,
          so they are statistically significant different among each other. <a href="#_Ref513458319">Figure 6</a> indicates that in simulations
          with <span class="math-span">𝑛 = 1000</span>, the evacuation rate
          increases with <span class="math-span">𝑝</span> and the number of
          signs <span class="math-span">𝑠</span> increases. For example,
          approximately 90% of the agents evacuate at 30 time-steps in a case of
          <span class="math-span">(𝑝, 𝑛, 𝑠) = (30%, 1000, 4)</span> of the

          the evacuation rates at <span class="math-span">𝑝 = 70% and

    <h1>Assessment of Simulation Results</h1>

      <h1>Predictive Simulation for Rare Cases</h1>
      <p>
        The relationship between frequency and scale of social events is said to
        follow the power law. Gutenberg–Richter law in seismology expresses the
        relationship between the magnitude and total number of earthquakes in
        any given region and time period. It means that there is little data to
        prove the effect of prevention plans for future disasters, where the
        size could be larger than what we expect at present. As it would require
        substantial recourse to prepare for such incidents, it is hard to make
        sufficient prevention plans. Once it happens, such conditions may cause
        more damages than the ones prepared for<span class="fn"><sup><a href="#ftn2" id="fn_pointer_ftn2" role="doc-noteref" title="Footnote 2: According to WHO, insufficient capacity of response for hazard situations is one component to cause disaster (WHO, 2002).">2</a></sup></span>.
        This means disaster simulations should be well designed to present the
        behavior of targets and the features of fields when the results are used
        in policy or decision making. We need to know that the results are
        guaranteed to be reasonable ones for all scenarios even if they are new
        scenarios that have not been seen before.
      </p>
      <p>
        In crowd evacuation simulations, verification and validation of the
        simulation tools and results have been one of the most important issues.
        Lovreglio et al. presented an evacuation model for experimental and
        simulation data in the field of fire evacuation that are influenced by a
        component of uncertainty in human behavior (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Lov14">Lovreglio, Ronchi, &amp; Borri, 2014</a>). The following
        questions arise from the test methods that are suggested from
        quantitative/qualitative attributes of points for behavioral uncertainty
        essential to ABSS applied to social simulations (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Ave05">Averill, Mileti, Peacock, Kuligowski, &amp; Groner,
          2005</a>).
      </p>
      <p>Q1. How do we judge if a tool is accurate enough?</p>
      <p>Q2. Which tests and how many should be performed to assess the
        accuracy of the model predictions?</p>
      <p>Q3. Who should perform the tests, i.e., the model developers, the
        model users, or a third party?</p>
      <p>These questions need to be answered to users who will employ the
        simulation results in their decisions.</p>
      <p>
        In addition, studies point out that the questions are applied in the
        field of the first class of applications, which are calculated with
        physical laws and two kinds of errors appear in simulations (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Ryo16">Kikuuwe, 2016</a>). The first type
        of error is associated with the modeling process and the second type is
        associated with the computations involved in the model; the process is
        formulated such that an occurrence in <span class="math-span">𝑃𝑆(𝐶,
          𝑁)</span>, one simulation results, is involved in <span class="math-span">𝑃𝑅(𝐶,
          𝐸)</span> where <span class="math-span">𝐶 = {𝑐<sub>𝑖</sub>}
        </span>, <span class="math-span">𝐸 = {𝑒<sub>𝑖</sub>}
        </span>, and <span class="math-span">𝑁 = {𝑛<sub>𝑖</sub>}
        </span> (<a href="#_Ref513459952">Figure 9</a>); <span class="math-span">𝑐<sub>𝑖</sub></span>
        are parameters that users can control, <span class="math-span">𝑒<sub>𝑖</sub></span>
        are parameters that users do not notice or cannot specify, <span class="math-span">𝑛<sub>𝑖</sub></span> are parameters that are
        introduced in the process of simulations, such as numerical errors and
        distributed computations.
      </p>
      <p>
        In calculating of some occurrences in <span class="math-span">𝑃𝑆(𝐶,
          𝑁)</span>, we accept the calculations as correct when their behaviors agree
        with our intuitions or are within probability laws. For example, think
        of Buffon's Needle, the dropped positions are different at every trial
        in real world and the prediction of the positions are taken to be
        correct when they follow law of great numbers instead of specifying all
        <span class="math-span">𝑐<sub>𝑖</sub></span> to fit the calculation
        within some errors. In the field of computer graphics, the idea of a
        plausible simulation presents such situations (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Bar96">Barzel, Hughes, &amp; Wood, 1996</a>).
      </p>
      <figure class="column-top" id="_Ref513459952">

        <figcaption class="multi-line-pdf">
          <strong>Figure 9.</strong> Errors introduced in modeling and
          computation phases.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The plausible idea is applied to the second and the third classes of
        applications where there is little or no precedent. The questions on the
        results of ABSS in social fields need to be specified more
        quantitatively. Q1 states necessary conditions where simulation results
        are applied in practical ways and implies that situations that have
        occurred in the past should be simulated with the model by setting
        parameters properly. Q2 refers to potential applications of evacuation
        simulations. By setting different parameters within a range of
        reasonable deviation, some simulations may show results beyond
        expectations. When we recognize that the cases may occur, the results
        may caution us about unintended damages. Q3 indicates that the concerned
        parties may evaluate the results with conflicting factors to make
        prevention plans<span class="fn"><sup><a href="#ftn3" id="fn_pointer_ftn3" role="doc-noteref" title="Footnote 3: For example, in the Great East Japan Earthquake, the power-supply unit of Fukushima Nuclear Plant was damaged by the 15m high tsunami, which caused the serious accidents.

    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>
      With the growth of technology, the ways we access information and provide
      data have been changing, and new media will affect human behaviors during
      emergencies in different ways that we assume at present. Systems adapting
      new technologies to prevent the emergencies are becoming outside of the
      scope of traditional methods of verification. To apply the new technology
      to real application, some criteria are required. The validation technique
      and related themes of simulating social incidents have been discussed;
      however, many validation ways of simulations are based on comparison with
      real or experimental data (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Hea09">Heath,
        Hill, &amp; Ciarallo, 2009</a>). Comparing with data is essential in the
      fields of the first class applications, but for the fields of the second
      and the third classes, where there are little data and it is difficult to
      perform experiments, alternative validation methods are required.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this paper, a CCEG management system was proposed based on the surveys
      on <span class="math-span">𝐸𝑆</span> and <span class="math-span">𝑃𝑆</span>.
      <span class="math-span">𝑃𝑆</span> is a new device and is thought to show
      the same effect as <span class="math-span">𝐸𝑆</span> during emergency. <span class="math-span">𝑃𝑆</span>'s effect of evacuation rate was simulated
      by ABSS and the validating ways of assessing the adoption of new
      technology were discussed. This validation provides an example to assess
      simulations in the fields of the second and third classes of applications
      that involves human behaviors, and acts as an explanatory data for
      adopting of new technology against future disasters.
