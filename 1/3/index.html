    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <p>Simulations have been used in multiple fields. Social simulation, in
      which humans play a major role in simulated scenarios, is one of the most
      promising fields in research. Human behavior is difficult to
      mathematically formulate. This makes it challenging to determine how well
      simulations mimic real situations; confirming simulation results
      empirically is also difficult. In this study, we present a new device that
      could change human behavior and provide a good method for mitigating
      damages during emergencies. We also consider ways of validating the
      simulation results to assess the new technology adoption.</p>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Disasters may occur anywhere at any time. In the past, we have been
      preparing for disasters in order to reduce the damage caused by them (<a
        role="doc-biblioref" href="#WHO02">World Health Organization [WHO],
        2002</a>). Weather forecast is one of the most common methods to foresee and
      plan for disasters such as heavy rainfall, typhoon, earthquakes, and other
      natural occurrences. The forecast is used to predict weather that may
      affect human life. Conditions under which disasters occur are
      wide-ranging; in the case of typhoons, news of a typhoon is announced a
      few days prior, while alerts on earthquakes are announced minutes before
      they occur at most. Prevention planning is executed to save lives during
      foreseen disasters, and drills are performed to improve the effectiveness
      of plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plans for disasters are designed to be equivalent to the most extreme
      cases of past disasters, or worse ones. It is ideal to perform drills in
      the assumed situations. However, even statutory training in real
      situations can create risks, especially for disabled people and some
      vulnerable groups. For example, a university in Nairobi, Kenya executed an
      anti-terror exercise without announcing it was a drill. People believed it
      was real and several of them jumped from the windows of the university
      buildings and were injured (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#BBC15">BBC
        News, 2015</a>). Therefore, drills are executed at least under the basic
      condition that participants know it is a drill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Computer simulations enable the examination of new scenarios that have not
      occurred in the real world. Social simulation, in which human behavior
      plays a major role in the simulated scenarios, is one of the most
      promising fields of simulation. Humans behave individually during
      emergencies; this behavior is difficult to mathematically formulate
      effectively. Therefore, it is challenging to determine how well
      simulations mimic real world situations. The development of Information
      Technology (IT) has inspired the introduction of new means to provide
      information to the public, especially travelers, and change human behavior
      to mitigate damages during emergencies (<a role="doc-biblioref"
        href="#FHA07">Federal Highway Administration [FHA], 2007</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      An agent-based simulation system (ABSS) can simulate the behaviors of
      people in unusual scenarios that are difficult to test in the real world.
      People activities and movements have been simulated and studied in various
      fields including computer graphics, movie special effects, and evacuation.
      For example, the influence of the existence of authority figures or agent
      characters on the evacuation behaviors was simulated (<a
        role="doc-biblioref" href="#Son17">Song, 2017</a>; <a
        role="doc-biblioref" href="#Son16">Song, 2016</a>; <a
        role="doc-biblioref" href="#Oka11">Okaya &amp; Toakahashi, 2011</a>).
      However, the results of simulations were not verified as pointed out,
      unlike physics-based models, models and results of social simulations are
      not readily verified through observation of real-world events or empirical
      testing (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Hei">Hahn, 2013</a>). The human
      behavior in the simulations has been modeled using the reports on target
      fields (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#GIH12">Hawe, Coates, Wilson,
        &amp; Crouch, 2012</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      In this paper, we discuss ways to assess a new method of evacuating people
      in life-threatening situations by simulation. The field of evacuation
      considers the case that humans are a component of the system. The
      remainder of this paper is set out as follows: In <a href="#Sect2">Section
        2</a>, the steps to model phenomena in the real world are presented. <a
        href="#Sect3">Section 3</a> describes a new evacuation guidance system
      using digital promotional signage (PS) that has been recently used in
      public and commercial areas. The effects of evacuation guidance on human
      evacuation flow control are tested using simulation, and the experimental
      results are discussed. In <a href="#Sect4">Section 4</a>, the ways of
      assessment of simulation results are discussed. <a href="#Sect5">Section
        5</a> provides a descriptive summary of our paper.

      <p>
        Simulations have been used in many fields for various purposes. The
        application fields are categorized into three classes: the first class
        consists of fields that are governed by scientific laws, the second
        class consists of fields that are related with humans. The human
        behaviors are not easily mathematically formulated but are represented
        in terms of text or data in documents. The third class is a combination
        of the first and the second. <a href="#_Ref511746582">Figure 1</a> shows
        a process of modeling phenomena that belong in the first class. The
        phenomena are observed and represented as

      <p>
        An example of the first class is physics. Physics is an empirical
        science and physical laws have been derived based on the principle:
        guess → compute consequence → compare experiment. When new phenomena are
        observed, more specific laws are developed by adding new parameters,
        reformulating relationships between them, and so on to achieve higher
        reliability (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#RPF67">Feynman, 1967</a>).
        The simulation results are used in fields within the applicable scope of
        the physical laws.

        Humans are a key component of social activities. These activities are
        the target field of classes two and three that we discussed earlier.
        Human behaviors that are described in texts or are documented as audio
        recording are implemented in simulations. The use of agent technology
        provides a platform to simulate social phenomena arising from the human
        activities (i.e., micro-behavior). The micro-specific approach has been
        accepted to solve complex real-world problems in various areas. For
        example, Jennings proposed a framework called <em>Social Level</em>, in
        which multi-agent systems (MAS) are targeted at systems composed of
        societies (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Jen99">Jennings, 1999</a>).
        The society possesses the following components:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Members</em>: entities performing the problem solving,
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Environment</em>: where members are situated,
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Means of interaction</em>: the ways members interact, and
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>

      <h1>Social Simulation to Prepare Prevention Planning for Disasters</h1>
      <p>
        Emergency situations arise from various causes and people behave
        differently during emergencies; for example, when there is an alarm to
        evacuate immediately, some people evacuate instantly and others may
        evacuate only after finishing their tasks. Various disasters such as
        fires, floods, typhoons, earthquakes, etc., occur at situations of
        different size, occurrence times, and so on. Kitano et al. (<a
          role="doc-biblioref" href="#Kit99">1999</a>) proposed a MAS-based
        social simulation platform, RoboCup Rescue Simulation (RCRS) to support
        rescue activities during disastrous situations. <a href="#_Ref511747742">Figure
          2</a> shows the modeling process and the flowchart of simulators that can
        simulate disaster situations in various cases and scenarios (<a

        Many people gather to watch games, exhibitions, political rallies, and
        other activities. For example, millions of pilgrims visit Mecca, Saudi
        Arabia during the same period every year. Although careful designs and
        operational plans have been made to ensure safe, secure and efficient
        movement of people in such crowded areas, the congestion of people has
        resulted in several disasters (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Tun">Tunasar,
          2013</a>). Crowd control is important to prevent disasters from occurring
        and to promote evacuation during emergencies.

        evacuation plan with a map on the wall. The ES and the map are assumed
        to be suitable media to prompt evacuations in public space. In 1986 and
        2011, questionnaire surveys were conducted on individuals asking, <q>What
          points do you feel anxious about in emergency situations?</q>, and <q>How
          do you behave when a fire occurs?</q> (<a role="doc-biblioref"

        reports contain similar observations in unfamiliar places, most people
        follow guidance from the public announcement (PA) system and from people
        around them.

      <p>
        We propose a crowd control and evacuation guidance (CCEG) management

        every few seconds. The right-side of <a href="#_Ref513457664">Figure
          4</a> shows an image of PS during an emergency. The CCEG system uses PS in
        the same way as ES during emergencies to guide people to safety. The
        guidance displayed on PS adaptively provides nearby people with the
        information to help them evacuate to safety or to control their movement
        as first responders guide them.

      <h1>Preliminary Surveys for Validating Effectiveness of the Proposed
        System</h1>
      <p>
        People seem to move without paying attention to signs until something
        unexpected happens, after which their behavior becomes unpredictable. To
        validate the effectiveness of the proposed system, we surveyed to
        determine whether people sufficiently notice signs in general. Two
        questionnaire surveys: test A and test B. were conducted at a subway
        mall in 2016 (<a href="#_Ref513457790">Figure 5</a>). The mall is 300 m
        length long, located underground, and has fourteen exits to the surface
        and adjacent buildings. The exits were numbered as shown in <a
          href="#_Ref513457790">Figure 5</a>. The images in the top half of the
        figure show the inside of the mall and were taken at circled-mark points
        in the afternoon. The subjects of the tests were different groups of our
        students at our university, who were asked to walk normally to exit
        number 7 in the mall along the route displayed in <a
          href="#_Ref513457790">Figure 5</a> on different days. At the end of
        the route, they were asked to recall the number and the locations of ES
        and digital PS that they spotted. In test A, participants were
        subsequently asked to retrace their path and count the number
        attentively; this corresponds to real emergency situations when we look
        for ES during evacuation. A shopping event was held while preforming
        test B, therefore, seven more PS were displayed than there was in test
        A.

        <a href="#_Ref511750109">Table 1</a> presents the number of signs that
        were spotted along the route in <a href="#_Ref513457790">Figure 5</a>,
        and demonstrates the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>People noticed at most 30% of ES when they walked unaware of
            these and detected about thrice the number of signs when they were
            attentive.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>There was little difference in the perception rates between the
            proportion of ES and PS noticed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>People unconsciously noticed a higher proportion of PS during
            an unexpected event.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This indicates that PS is assumed to function as ES in an emergency
        and more signs can guide more people to evacuate properly.</p>

      <h1>Validation of Hypothesis by Simulation Results</h1>
      <p>
        Evacuations from the mall are simulated by an ABSS, TENDENKO (<a
          role="doc-biblioref" href="#Oka11">Okaya &amp; Takahashi, 2011</a>).
        TENDENKO has been developed based on RCRS and it can simulate evacuation
        behaviors from multistory buildings. Social force model is used to
        calculate human motions during the evacuation (<a role="doc-biblioref"
          href="#Hel02">Helbing, Farkas, Molnár, &amp; Vixsek, 2002</a>). The
        rescue management office can provide information for people to evacuate
        through PA and signs, and agents can hear public announcements and see
        the signs around them. In every simulation step, the agents perceive the
        data around them, select an action to achieve their goal from a set of
        prescribed actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The effect of our CCEG is tested by simulating the following scenarios.
        Agents evacuate initially from the exit announced by the PA. The first
        message of PA is <q>Fire near exit number 1, evacuate from exit
          number 7</q>. This message is sent to all agents, and the agents follow
        the message. As time passes, CCEG displays new information on some PAs.
        The information is set suitable for dynamically changing situations, and
        the message is <q>Go to the nearest exit. The number of exit X</q>; the
        agents within 10 m can see the message. Some of the agents change their
        goal and go the exit X according to the new message, while others do not
        and go to the previous goal, the exit number 7.
      </p>
      <p>
        The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) published a
        technical report on occupant behavior during evacuation from a fire
        emergency (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#ISO09">ISO, 2009</a>). The
        technical report addresses parameters in designing for life safety and
        assessment the condition of occupants of the building with respect to
        time. The building parameters include floor layouts, warning systems,
        etc. The parameters of occupants are the number of occupants, their
        locations in the building, etc. Two basic values: available safe-escape
        time and required safe-escape time, which are taken by occupants to
        evacuate from buildings, are chosen to evaluate prevention plans against
        fire.
      </p>
      <p>We used the evacuation rate, which shows how many people have
        evacuated, as a parameter to evaluate new proposals with three changing
        parameters:</p>

                        </math>
            is the rate of agents who follow the guidance. We observed that some
            agents evacuated immediately, while others did not even though they
            heard the announcements of evacuation (<a role="doc-biblioref"

          Nowadays, security video cameras are commonplace in cities worldwide.
          At places where crowds of hundreds or thousands gather, such
          monitoring is important for safety and security purposes and human
          operators are generally employed for the task at large events (<a
            role="doc-biblioref" href="#Moo11">Moore, Ali, Mehran, &amp;
            Shah, 2011</a>). As a result, camera monitoring system could be used as
          a component of CCEG management system using PS.

        The relationship between frequency and scale of social events is said to
        follow the power law. Gutenberg–Richter law in seismology expresses the
        relationship between the magnitude and total number of earthquakes in
        any given region and time period. It means that there is little data to
        prove the effect of prevention plans for future disasters, where the
        size could be larger than what we expect at present. As it would require
        substantial recourse to prepare for such incidents, it is hard to make
        sufficient prevention plans. Once it happens, such conditions may cause
        more damages than the ones prepared for<span class="fn"><sup><a

        This means disaster simulations should be well designed to present the
        behavior of targets and the features of fields when the results are used
        in policy or decision making. We need to know that the results are
        guaranteed to be reasonable ones for all scenarios even if they are new
        scenarios that have not been seen before.

        In crowd evacuation simulations, verification and validation of the
        simulation tools and results have been one of the most important issues.
        Lovreglio et al. presented an evacuation model for experimental and
        simulation data in the field of fire evacuation that are influenced by a
        component of uncertainty in human behavior (<a role="doc-biblioref"
          href="#Lov14">Lovreglio, Ronchi, &amp; Borri, 2014</a>). The following
        questions arise from the test methods that are suggested from
        quantitative/qualitative attributes of points for behavioral uncertainty
        essential to ABSS applied to social simulations (<a role="doc-biblioref"
          href="#Ave05">Averill, Mileti, Peacock, Kuligowski, &amp; Groner,
          2005</a>).
      </p>
      <p>Q1. How do we judge if a tool is accurate enough?</p>
      <p>Q2. Which tests and how many should be performed to assess the
        accuracy of the model predictions?</p>
      <p>Q3. Who should perform the tests, i.e., the model developers, the
        model users, or a third party?</p>
      <p>These questions need to be answered to users who will employ the
        simulation results in their decisions.</p>
      <p>
        In addition, studies point out that the questions are applied in the
        field of the first class of applications, which are calculated with
        physical laws and two kinds of errors appear in simulations (<a
          role="doc-biblioref" href="#Ryo16">Kikuuwe, 2016</a>). The first type
        of error is associated with the modeling process and the second type is
        associated with the computations involved in the model; the process is
        formulated such that an occurrence in

        The plausible idea is applied to the second and the third classes of
        applications where there is little or no precedent. The questions on the
        results of ABSS in social fields need to be specified more
        quantitatively. Q1 states necessary conditions where simulation results
        are applied in practical ways and implies that situations that have
        occurred in the past should be simulated with the model by setting
        parameters properly. Q2 refers to potential applications of evacuation
        simulations. By setting different parameters within a range of
        reasonable deviation, some simulations may show results beyond
        expectations. When we recognize that the cases may occur, the results
        may caution us about unintended damages. Q3 indicates that the concerned
        parties may evaluate the results with conflicting factors to make
        prevention plans<span class="fn"><sup><a href="#ftn3"

    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>
      With the growth of technology, the ways we access information and provide
      data have been changing, and new media will affect human behaviors during
      emergencies in different ways that we assume at present. Systems adapting
      new technologies to prevent the emergencies are becoming outside of the
      scope of traditional methods of verification. To apply the new technology
      to real application, some criteria are required. The validation technique
      and related themes of simulating social incidents have been discussed;
      however, many validation ways of simulations are based on comparison with
      real or experimental data (<a role="doc-biblioref" href="#Hea09">Heath,
        Hill, &amp; Ciarallo, 2009</a>). Comparing with data is essential in the
      fields of the first class applications, but for the fields of the second
      and the third classes, where there are little data and it is difficult to
      perform experiments, alternative validation methods are required.
    </p>
    <p>In this paper, a CCEG management system was proposed based on the
      surveys on ES and PS. PS is a new device and is thought to show the same
      effect as ES during emergency. PS’s effect of evacuation rate was
      simulated by ABSS and the validating ways of assessing the adoption of new
      technology were discussed. This validation provides an example to assess
      simulations in the fields of the second and third classes of applications
      that involves human behaviors, and acts as an explanatory data for
      adopting of new technology against future disasters.</p>
